### **Who is Ripple Labs?**
In 2011 Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto were interested in bitcoin, however they were focused on a more sustainable system for sending value without the mining factor. Thus in 2012 they launched the XRP ledger. Later, in 2012 Jed McCaleb alongside his angel investor Chris Larsen founded the company NewCoin which was quickly renamed to OpenCoin before finally settling on Ripple Labs which would incorporate the XRP ledger. Since Chris Larsen's original investment Ripple has raised over $290 million dollars in various rounds of funding. With a heavy focus on blockchain technology Ripple Labs has been focused on delivering fast and cheap cross-border payments, crypto liquidity, and a platform for CBDCS (Central Banks Digital Currencies).

### **Ripple's Products**
*Cross-Border Payments*
- Deliver real-time global payments without tying up capital in destination markets.
- Their technology and global network enable remittances, SME payments, disbursements and treasury flows that are faster, more reliable, and more affordable for organizations and their customers.

*Crypto Liquidity*
- Ripple Liquidity Hub is a turn-key platform that provides businesses with a streamlined way to buy, sell, and hold digital assets. Businesses can access multiple liquidity pools and advanced trading features, including post-trade settlement, all through a single-API experience.

*CBDCs & Stablecoins*
- The Ripple CBDC Platform offers a comprehensive platform for minting, managing, transacting, and destroying CBDCs and Stablecoins.
- Each solution is built on a private ledger that is based upon XRP Ledger technology.


### **Ripple's Edge...**
Ripple's intended customers are central banks, banks and financial intermediaries, and enterprises. Ripple is not limited by the location or the size of their customers, thus giving them an extremely wide market to capture.  The more organizations on board the more useful and valuable Ripple’s products become.

The SWIFT banking system is a major competitor of Ripple’s. The SWIFT system is how banks move fund between each other. However, Ripples XRP ledger allows for funds to move cheaper and faster than the SWIFT system. Additionally, SWIFT system is limited banks, while the XRP ledger is not limited to just banks, but rather funds can be moved with ease between enterprises and banks.

When it comes to traditional payment Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal serve as the top competitors to Ripple. However, these entities face cross-border issues that Ripple’s XRP ledger does not have to worry about. Thus, disrupting international payment and remittance.

Popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake network consensus protocols. These protocols increase the price of transactions and tend to warp the behavior of validators on the networks.  This is why Ripple uses a quorum-based consensus protocol. This protocol allows transactions to be a fraction of the price compared to bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as have transactions complete in 3-5 seconds compared to 10 minutes or more for bitcoin.

### **A Look Into the Market**
Ripple is a unique fintech company because it operates within two domains, payments and blockchain. The major players in the Payments domain consist of PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, American Express.  While in the blockchain domain Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, and Stellar have been the major players.

Over the last couple years there has been a real push to cut costs on payments and transactions. As well as bringing the associated products to as many institutions and consumers as possible. Blockchain companies are in a race to provide the cheapest payment solutions and the fastest speeds.

Additionally, since April 2021 there have been 11 CBDCs launched, currently 21 in pilot programs, and another 32 currently in development. CBDC landscape is growing fast as governments and central banks look to harness the benefits.

### **Ripple measures its success in two ways**
*Partnerships*
- Consistently developing new partnerships with institutions across the globe.
- These partnerships often open institutions to payment solutions.
- Partnerships with central banks to help host their CBDCs.
- Thus far ripple has provided payment and crypto solutions to Travelex Bank, Insarem, Novatti, Tranglo, MoneyMatch, Siam Commercial Bank, MoneyNetint, SBI Remit, and many more.

*XRP Ledger Performance*
- XRP ledger currently handles 1500 transactions per second with hopes to increase this amount.
- XRP can handle more than 50x the transactions of Bitcoin and Ethereum putting it in a tier of its own, at a fraction of the cost comparatively. 
- VISA currently handles about 1700 transactions per second which ripple quickly hopes to close the gap.
- The SWIFT banking system only handles 160 transactions per second.

### **Recommendations...**
I believe Ripple Labs should offer a full-fledged cryptocurrency and foreign currency exchange operating in all jurisdictions across the globe. As it stands now there aren’t many secure and trusted crypto currency exchanges across the globe.  The major players right now are Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Kraken, all of which are serving specific parts of the globe for the most part. 

I believe starting this exchange to be a wise decision because this will bring value to the existing products Ripple offers and vice versa. Money transfers on the existing exchanges can be a daunting task right now because cross-border money movements, regulatory environment, KYC, and high fees. However, Ripple’s XRP ledger would give Ripple a competitive advantage over the existing exchanges because XRP does not face the same issues as previously mentioned. XRP was built to with many of these issues in mind.

As mentioned before central banks across the globe are looking to release their own CBDCs.  By Ripple hosting its own global crypto and foreign exchange it can marry its existing CBDCs with foreign exchange markets and crypto markets, thus providing more liquidity and access to anyone and everyone everywhere.

By Ripple hosting its own global exchange it will funnel more customers to its existing lines of business and open themselves up to more markets and more opportunities. All while building on their existing CBDC platform and XRP ledger.
